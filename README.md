# Stroop-Brain-Game
<i>Make School MOB 1.1: Final Project</i>


This project is a mobile game that tests your ability to combat the Stroop Effect. It was built in Xcode using SwiftUI. 

The [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) is a psychological phenomenon in which reaction time is delayed due to conflicting inputs, most commonly exemplified by the test in which words describing colors are written in a text color that does not match the meaning of the work (such as "Green" written in black font).
