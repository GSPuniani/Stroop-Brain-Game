# Stroop-Brain-Game
<i>Make School MOB 1.1: Final Project</i>


This project is a mobile game that tests your ability to combat the Stroop Effect. It was built in Xcode using the SwiftUI framework. 

The [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) is a psychological phenomenon in which reaction time is delayed due to conflicting inputs, most commonly exemplified by the test in which words describing colors are written in a text color that does not match the meaning of the work (such as "Green" written in black font). The trick is to describe the color of the text without being misled by the written text itself. 

In this game, users are presented with two cards, each with a color written on them. The top card is written in the color that it describes, while the bottom card can have a color that does not correspond to the word itself. The goal of the game is to answer as many prompts correctly as possible in 60 seconds. Users should select "Yes" if the top card describes the color of the word on the bottom card and select "No" otherwise in order to answer correctly. Users earn 10 points for each correct response and lose 10 points for each incorrect response.
